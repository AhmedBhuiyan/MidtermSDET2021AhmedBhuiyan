According to sun, there is only 4 states in thread life cycle in java new,
runnable, non-runnable and terminated. There is no running state. But for
better understanding the threads, we are explaining it in the 5 states.
The life cycle of the thread in java is controlled by JVM.

6.what is class?
Java is an object-oriented programming language.
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.


7.What is object?

point to an application. Application entry points are used to control
users' access to different versions of an application that is deployed on a platform.

9.Why main is static?
Java program's main method has to be declared static because keyword static
allows main to be called without creating an object of the class in which
the main method is defined. ... Without having declared main method static ,
your program will successfully compile but won't execute and report error at run time.



10.Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Java. lang. Object class is the root or superclass of the class hierarchy,
which is present in java.


11.What is difference between path and classpath variables?

The reason behind this is to prevent ambiguity.java compiler cannot decide, which display method

19.What is method overloading and when it happens?
Method overloading is a programming technique that allows developers to use the same method name
multiple times in the same class, but with different parameters. In this case, we say that the
method is overloaded.
20.Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
The classic definition of an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program
and that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. Exceptions are specialized events that indicate
something bad has happened in the application, and the application either needs to recover or exit.
